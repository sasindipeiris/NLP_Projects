This repository serves as a central hub for all NLP-related projects - both completed and upcoming. 

Below descriptions provide a basic overview of each individual project.Detailed descriptions can be found on each README file

# NLP with disaster tweets

A classification project that focuses on identifying whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. It involves preprocessing tweet text, tokenizing it, and training a deep learning model (such as DistilBERT) to perform binary classification. The project includes steps like exploratory data analysis, sequence preparation, model training with validation, and evaluation using accuracy and F1 score metrics to ensure reliable disaster detection from short, noisy social media messages.

# Drawing with LLMs

A generative project that uses a large language model (Gemma 2 9B IT) to translate natural language prompts into valid SVG code. The model is guided by a structured prompt format and enforced with rule-based constraints to ensure that the output SVGs are renderable and syntactically correct. It features quantized model loading for efficiency, validation through XML parsing and regex, and a fallback mechanism for robustness, showcasing a practical application of LLMs in structured, code-based image generation.
